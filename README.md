Removed TransactionDetailsVC. 
Corrected CategorySelectionVC. Category Selection was coded as a tableview controller. It is not. It is a regular view. 
Debug code continues to throw fatal error when Add Transction button is clicked. 
The error says the text fields are not connected even though they show as connected in the code and storyboard. 
This should be simple, but the textfields connection issue is causing the problems.
